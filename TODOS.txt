Valentines Day Surprise

- Login screen that takes in her favorite flower as the username and her birthday as the password
- Once logged in the screen will explode with her favorite flower colored as green
- Slides will display text kinda like how I did my personal portfolio, with a cloudy green background and big bubble letters
